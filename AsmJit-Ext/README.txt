AsmJit-Ext - AsmJit Extensions Project======================================AsmJit-Ext is project was designed to share common problems and their solutionswith AsmJit community. Anyone who has usable source code which can be publishedunder the same license as AsmJit library can share the code in this repository.The goal of this project is also to maintain these projects and port them intonew AsmJit version if needed.Active extensions:RemoteCodeGenerator===================Remote code generator is extension for windows which uses virtual of anotherprocess to inject the code into it. It's currently very simple solution thatworks only with 32-bit to 32-bit process or 64-bit to 640bit process. It's usingthe windows function WriteProcessMemory() together with virtual memory allocator.
