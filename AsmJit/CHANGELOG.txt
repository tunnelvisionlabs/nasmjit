2009-03-23
- Fixed 64 bit jump table problems and 64 bit addressing again

2009-03-22:
- Fixed x64 addressing
- Added more embeddable types into Serializer (dfloat, ddouble)
- Updated JumpTable and added Compiler::jumpToTable() method to invoking jump

2009-03-20:
- Added possibility to set code generation flags in Serializer:
  Assembler:
   - OptimizeAlign - Use processor best way to align instruction stream
   - EmitConditionHints - Emit condition hints HINT_TAKEN, HINT_NOT_TAKEN
   - AlwaysEmitRex - Force rex prefix (for x64)
  Compiler:
   - OptimizePrologEpilog - Optimize prolog/epilog
- Added sfence() cleanup to Function
- Added JumpTable and Compiler::newJumpTable
- Removed Relocable, same effect is to use Compiler::newImmediate()

2009-03-19:
- Fixed problems with new memory allocator
- Enchanced mov(reg, imm) instruction in 64 bit mode to use only 4 byte immediate
  if it's possible
- Changed Compiler::build() to Compiler::serialize()

2009-03-18:
- Added segment override prefixes
- Added absolute addressing for x86 (32 bit mode)
- Added memory operands to Labels with displacements.
- Added absolute jumps to Compiler - jmp(), call() instructions
- Added MemoryManager
- Added Lock (used by MemoryManager)
- Updated logger
- Removed jmp_ptr
- Added embedding data in code possibility + basic methods
  (db, dw, dd, dq, dptr, ...)
- Added make() to Serializer, allows Assembler and Compiler to use same
  method to make functions.
- Renamed AsmJit::VM to AsmJit::VirtualMemory
- Updated examples to use new MemoryManager and Serializer::make() methods
- Added memory test application

2009-03-09
- Released 0.6

2009-03-08
- Released 0.6-rc1
- Implemented preferred registers allocation
- Documentation updates

2009-03-04
- Improved Compiler
- Fixed alloc/spill of MM and XMM registers
- Added better prolog / epilog code
- Added support for custom spill / restore functions (to bypass default 
  ones - this is mainly for MMX/SSE programming)
- Added first implementation of State (state of current variables that can
  be saved or restored)
- Fixed wrong sfence() data in instruction map

2009-02-26:
- Released 0.6-alpha
- Fixed many bugs related to assembler and compiler parts. Tested MMX and 
  SSE2 code generation.
- Finished basic parts of compiler and register allocation, but there are
  still space for improvements

2009-02-18:
- Added 3dNow! and enchanced 3dNow! instructions

2009-02-17:
- Fixed few bugs
- added few remaining instructions in basic x86 instruction set

2009-02-15
- Complete rewrite
- Added Serializer
- Added typesafe operands, introduced new operand Relocable
- Assembler uses Serializer to serialize instructions and only overrides 
  _emitX86() method to emit binary code.

2009-02-10
- Released 0.5.1 bugfix release
- Fixed movdqa(), movdqu() bugs
- Added new register constructors (they are used by Compiler)

2009-02-08
- Released 0.5 (should be last stable release before Compiler support)
- Fixed few GCC issues, fixed one broken opcode
- Code refactorization, X86 to Assembler, refactorized header files

2009-02-08
- Relocations, toOffset(), released 0.4

2009-02-03
- Cleanup, released 0.3.2

2009-02-02
- Fixed issue #3, mmx/sse instructions with immediates and movd().

2009-01-26:
- Finished X64 support

2009-01-23:
- Fixed wrong asserts in some instructions
- Added some new instructions
- Added some examples to the documentataion

2009-01-22:
