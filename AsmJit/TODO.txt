TODO (Compiler):
[ ] Add ASMJIT_NOTHOW to all functions that can't throw exception
[ ] Add instruction reordering possibility in compiler (complex)
[ ] What about float and double variables in compiler ?
    Current implementation can reserve memory for these types, but can't
    alloc registers for them (because x87 is stack based).

TODO (Architecture):
[ ] ARM support
