TODO (Compiler):
[ ] Add ASMJIT_NOTHOW to all functions that can't throw exception
[ ] Function return values should be supported
[ ] Add possibility to easy call other functions through AsmJit::Compiler
[ ] Add possibility to set register allocator method 
    (to alloc preserved registers first or not - will be used together with
     calling different functions from jit generated code)
[ ] Add instruction reordering possibility in compiler (complex)
[ ] What about float and double variables in compiler ?
    Current implementation can reserve memory for these types, but can't
    alloc registers for them (because x87 is stack based).

TODO (Architecture):
[ ] ARM support
