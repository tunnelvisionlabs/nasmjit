TODO (Assembler):
[ ] Add SSE4a instruction set (AMD) - What is missing ?
[x] Add Enter/Leave instructions
[ ] Add absolute addressing possibilities for jmp and call instructions
    (x86 and x64)
[x] Add relative addressing possibilities to Label* for memory operands

TODO (Compiler):
[ ] Add instruction reordering possibility in compiler (complex)
[ ] Add jump table builder (complex)
[ ] What about float and double in compiler ?
    Current implementation can reserve memory for these types, but can't
    alloc registers for them (because x87 is stack based).

TODO (Architecture):
[ ] ARM support
