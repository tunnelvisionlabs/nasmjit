TODO (Assembler):
[ ] Add absolute addressing to pointer for x86 32 bit mode (in 64 mode this 
    will not be never possible).
[ ] Add SSE4a instruction set (AMD) - What is missing ?

TODO (Compiler):
[x] Add saving / restoring states
[x] Add pluggable spill and reload of variables (mainly for MM/XMM registers)
[x] Add spill/restore for MM/XMM registers
[ ] Add instruction reordering possibility in compiler
[ ] Add jump table builder (probably only for compiler, this is complex task)
[ ] What about float and double in compiler ?

TODO (Architecture)
[ ] Add support for ARM architecture
