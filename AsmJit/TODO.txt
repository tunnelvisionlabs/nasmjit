TODO (Assembler):
[ ] Add absolute addressing to pointer for x86 32 bit mode (in 64 mode this 
    will not be never possible).
[ ] Add SSE4a instruction set (AMD).

TODO (Compiler):
[ ] Add saving / restoring states
[ ] Add pluggable spill and reload of variables (mainly for MM/XMM registers)
[ ] Add spill/restore for MM/XMM registers
[ ] Add instruction reordering plugin (and design plugin architecture for asm)
[ ] Add jump table builder (probably only for compiler, this is complex think)

TODO (Architecture)
[ ] Add support for ARM architecture
