//!
//! @brief AsmJit is a complete x86/x64 JIT Assembler for C++ language.
//!
//! It supports FPU, MMX, 3dNow, SSE, SSE2, SSE3 and SSE4 intrinsics, powerful
//! compiler that helps to write portable functions for 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit
//! (x64) architectures. AsmJit can be used to create functions at runtime that
//! can be called from existing (but also generated) C/C++ code.
//!
//! AsmJit is a cross-platform library that supports various compilers and
//! operating systems. Currently only limitation is x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit)
//! processor. Currently tested operating systems are Windows (32-bit and 64-bit),
//! Linux (32-bit and 64-bit) and MacOSX (32-bit and 64-bit).
//!
//! @section AsmJit_Main_Introduction Introduction
//!
//! AsmJit library contains two main classes for code generation with different
//! goals. First main code generation class is called @c asmjit::Assembler and
//! contains low level API that can be used to generate JIT binary code. It
//! directly emits binary stream that represents encoded x86/x64 assembler
//! opcodes. Together with operands and labels it can be used to generate
//! complete code. For details look to @ref asmjit_base and @ref asmjit_compiler
//! sections.
//!
//! There is also class named @c asmjit::BaseCompiler that allows to develop
//! cross-platform assembler code without worring about function calling
//! conventions and registers allocation. It can be also used to write 32-bit
//! and 64-bit portable code. Compiler is a recommended concept to use for code
//! generation.
//!
//! Everything in AsmJit library is in @c asmjit namespace.

//! @section AsmJit_Main_Terminology Terminology
//!
//! - <b>Non-volatile (preserved) register</b> - Register that can't be changed
//!   by callee (callee must save and restore it if it want to use it inside).
//!
//! - <b>Volatile (non-preserved) register</b> - The opossite. Register that can
//!   be freely used by callee. The caller must free all registers before calling
//!   other function.

//! @defgroup asmjit_base Platform neutral API, abstract classes and operands.
//!
//! Contains all AsmJit classes and helper functions that are neutral or
//! abstract. All abstract classes are reimplemented for every supported
//! architecture.
//!
//! - See @c asmjit::Assembler class for low level code generation
//!   documentation.
//! - See @c asmjit::Operand for AsmJit operand's overview.
//!
//! @section AsmJit_Core_Registers Registers
//!
//! There are static objects that represents X86 and X64 registers. They can
//! be used directly (like @c eax, @c mm, @c xmm, ...) or created through
//! these functions:
//!
//! - @c asmjit::gpb_lo() - Get Gp-LO register (BYTE).
//! - @c asmjit::gpb_hi() - Get Gp-HI register (BYTE).
//! - @c asmjit::gpw() - Get Gp register (WORD).
//! - @c asmjit::gpd() - Get Gp register (DWORD).
//! - @c asmjit::gpq() - Get Gp register (QWORD).
//! - @c asmjit::gpz() - Get Gp register (DWORD/QWORD).
//! - @c asmjit::fp()  - Get Fp register.
//! - @c asmjit::mm()  - Get Mmx register (QWORD).
//! - @c asmjit::xmm() - Get Xmm register (DQWORD).
//!
//! @section AsmJit_Core_Addressing Addressing
//!
//! X86 and x64 architectures contains several addressing modes and most ones
//! are possible with AsmJit library. Memory represents are represented by
//! @c asmjit::BaseMem class. These functions are used to make operands that
//! represents memory addresses:
//!
//! - @c asmjit::ptr()
//! - @c asmjit::byte_ptr()
//! - @c asmjit::word_ptr()
//! - @c asmjit::dword_ptr()
//! - @c asmjit::qword_ptr()
//! - @c asmjit::tword_ptr()
//! - @c asmjit::dqword_ptr()
//! - @c asmjit::intptr_ptr()
//!
//! Most useful function to make pointer should be @c asmjit::ptr(). It creates
//! pointer to the target with unspecified size. Unspecified size works in all
//! intrinsics where are used registers (this means that size is specified by
//! register operand or by instruction itself). For example @c asmjit::ptr()
//! can't be used with @c asmjit::Assembler::inc() instruction. In this case
//! size must be specified and it's also reason to make difference between
//! pointer sizes.
//!
//! Supported are simple address forms (register + displacement) and complex
//! address forms (register + (register << shift) + displacement).
//!
//! @section AsmJit_Core_Immediates Immediates
//!
//! Immediate values are constants thats passed directly after instruction
//! opcode. To create such value use @c asmjit::imm() or @c asmjit::imm_u()
//! methods to create signed or unsigned immediate value.
//!
//! @sa @c asmjit::BaseCompiler.

//! @defgroup asmjit_compiler Compiler (high-level code generation).
//!
//! Contains classes related to @c asmjit::Compiler that can be used
//! to generate code using high-level constructs.
//!
//! - See @c Compiler class for high level code generation
//!   documentation - calling conventions, function declaration
//!   and variables management.

//! @defgroup asmjit_config Configuration.
//!
//! Contains macros that can be redefined to fit into any project.

//! @defgroup asmjit_cpuinfo CPU information.
//!
//! X86 or x64 cpuid instruction allows to get information about processor
//! vendor and it's features. It's always used to detect features like MMX,
//! SSE and other newer ones.
//!
//! AsmJit library supports low level cpuid call implemented internally as
//! C++ function using inline assembler or intrinsics and also higher level
//! CPU features detection. The low level function (also used by higher level
//! one) is @c asmjit::cpuid().
//!
//! AsmJit library also contains higher level function @c asmjit::getCpu()
//! that returns features detected by the library. The detection process is
//! done only once and the returned object is always the same. @c asmjit::BaseCpu
//! structure not contains only information through @c asmjit::cpuid(), but
//! there is also small multiplatform code to detect number of processors
//! (or cores) through operating system API.
//!
//! It's recommended to use @c asmjit::cpuInfo to detect and check for
//! host processor features.
//!
//! Example how to use asmjit::cpuid():
//!
//! @code
//! // All functions and structures are in asmjit namesapce.
//! using namespace asmjit;
//!
//! // Here will be retrieved result of cpuid call.
//! CpuId out;
//!
//! // Use cpuid function to do the job.
//! cpuid(0 /* eax */, &out /* eax, ebx, ecx, edx */);
//!
//! // If eax argument to cpuid is 0, ebx, ecx and edx registers
//! // are filled with cpu vendor.
//! char vendor[13];
//! memcpy(i->vendor, &out.ebx, 4);
//! memcpy(i->vendor + 4, &out.edx, 4);
//! memcpy(i->vendor + 8, &out.ecx, 4);
//! vendor[12] = '\0';
//!
//! // Print vendor
//! puts(vendor);
//! @endcode
//!
//! If the high-level interface of asmjit::BaseCpu is not enough, you can use
//! low-level asmjit::cpuid() when running on x86/x64 host, but please read
//! processor manuals provided by Intel, AMD or other manufacturer for cpuid
//! details.
//!
//! Example of using @c asmjit::BaseCpu::getHost():
//!
//! @code
//! // All functions and structures are in asmjit namesapce.
//! using namespace asmjit;
//!
//! // Call to cpuInfo return BaseCpu structure that shouldn't be modified.
//! // Make it const by default.
//! const BaseCpu* cpu = BaseCpu::getHost();
//!
//! // Now you are able to get specific features.
//!
//! // Processor has SSE2
//! if (cpu->features & kCpuFeatureSse2) {
//!   // your code...
//! }
//! // Processor has MMX
//! else if (cpu->features & kCpuFeature_MMX) {
//!   // your code...
//! }
//! // Processor is old, no SSE2 or MMX support.
//! else {
//!   // your code...
//! }
//! @endcode
//!
//! Better example is in app/test/testcpu.cpp file.


//! @defgroup asmjit_logging Logging and error handling.
//!
//! Contains classes related to loging. Currently logging is implemented in
//! @ref asmjit::BaseLogger class. The function @ref asmjit::BaseLogger::log()
//! can be overridden to redirect logging into any user-defined stream.
//!
//! To log your assembler output to FILE stream use this code:
//!
//! @code
//! // Create assembler
//! Assembler a;
//!
//! // Create and set file based logger
//! FileLogger logger(stderr);
//! a.setLogger(&logger);
//! @endcode
//!
//! You can see that logging goes through @c Assembler. If you are using
//! @c Compiler and you want to log messages in correct assembler order,
//! you should look at @ref Compiler::comment() method. It allows  you to
//! insert text message into items stream so the @c Compiler is able to
//! send messages to @ref Assembler in correct order.
//!
//! @sa @c asmjit::BaseLogger, @c asmjit::FileLogger.


//! @defgroup AsmJit_MemoryManagement Virtual memory management.
//!
//! Using @c asmjit::Assembler or @c asmjit::Compiler to generate machine
//! code is not final step. Each generated code needs to run in memory
//! that is not protected against code execution. To alloc this code it's
//! needed to use operating system functions provided to enable execution
//! code in specified memory block or to allocate memory that is not
//! protected. The solution is always to use @c See asmjit::Assembler::make()
//! and @c asmjit::Compiler::make() functions that can allocate memory and
//! relocate code for you. But AsmJit also contains classes for manual memory
//! management thats internally used by AsmJit but can be used by programmers
//! too.
//!
//! Memory management contains low level and high level classes related to
//! allocating and freeing virtual memory. Low level class is
//! @c asmjit::VMem that can allocate and free full pages of virtual memory
//! provided by operating system. Higher level class is @c asmjit::MemoryManager
//! that is able to manage complete allocation and free mechanism. It
//! internally uses larger chunks of memory to make allocation fast and
//! effective.
//!
//! Using @c asmjit::VMem::alloc() is cross-platform way how to allocate this
//! kind of memory without worrying about operating system and it's API. Each
//! memory block that is no longer needed should be released by @ref
//! asmjit::VMem::release() method. Higher-level interface for virtual memory
//! allocation can be found at asmjit::MemoryManager class.
//!
//! @sa @c asmjit::VMem, @ asmjit::MemoryManager.
